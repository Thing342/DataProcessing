This document is intended to describe how one can set up an environment to run TravelMapping's site update program to generate the same logs, stats, and database file that are produced as part of TM's regular site update process.  A separate document is planned in the [Web repository](https://github.com/TravelMapping/Web/) to describe how to take the information generated by the update to populate a database and configure the Web-facing code to use it.  The expectation is that this is run in a Unix-like environment such as the Mac OS X Terminal, or Linux or FreeBSD.  It is likely the same or similar commands will work on Windows in something like Cygwin or Git Bash, but this has not been tested.

### Cloning Needed Repositories

Information from three repositories is needed to run the site update process:

1. [DataProcessing](https://github.com/TravelMapping/DataProcessing/)
2. [HighwayData](https://github.com/TravelMapping/HighwayData/)
3. [UserData](https://github.com/TravelMapping/UserData/)

These should be cloned into the same parent directory.  Typically, this might be called "travelmapping" and sit off the user's home directory.  Below, we will assume that directory is in an environment variable TMBASE, so we refer to it as $(TMBASE).
